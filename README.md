## About The Project

A simple, yet powerful search homepage. This project provides a seamless entry point to two distinct search experiences: Perplexity for AI-driven answers and DuckDuckGo for privacy-focused results. It demonstrates an ability to build a clean, functional application that addresses a key user need in today's digital landscape.

## Getting Started

To get started, open gofor in a browser tab and click on the search variant you want to use. Then, copy the URL of the site with the searchbar. Finally, open your browser settings and set the URL as your new tab homepage URL.
